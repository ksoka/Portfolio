        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <div>I've been playing guitar since I was 13 years old. I started it with electric guitar however nowadays I play acoustic
             guitar in fingerstyle. When I was in my high school at Madetoja I was in a couple of bands. However after school I've
             been playing just by myself. I mainly play cover songs from movies, other artists and games. I arrange the songs myself
             most of the time though sometimes I do work on established arrangements.
             My main guitar is Lakewood M-32 CP that I bought in 2023. My other guitars that I own are Hagstr√∂m Mocon 2 and I have
             Indie electric guitar.

        <h2>climbing</h2>
        <div>I started climbing in 2023 and have been doing it very actively ever since. I've mainly done bouldering though I do
             occationally do some rope climbing as well. I've also climbed outdoor. I currently climb on around 7a+ grade though I've
             managed to top a couple of harder routes as well.

    paragliding = (

        <h2>Paragliding</h2>
        <div>I started paragliding in 2024. I've only so far began my courses on it. The goal is to do some casual flying
             and try many different areas of paragliding.
        </div>

    coffee = (
        <>
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <div>Some might not think coffee as a hobby so what I mean with coffee as a hobby is that I have some more coffee
             equipment than just your normal filter coffee maker. I started researching better coffee equipment in 2022 and
             I have been testing all sorts of things regarding coffee since. I have a coffee grinder at home and I own
             couple of different types of coffee makers to give coffee some variety. I also test out different more expensive
             coffees form different roasters.

    gaming = (
        <>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <div>I've been playing games since early childhood and I still play nowadays. I play on PlayStation and on Nintendo 
             Switch. I have very big interest on game design and I do have a plan to start a project on my own game.
