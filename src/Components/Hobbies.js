            <div className="textContextText">I've been playing guitar since I was 13 years old. I started it with electric guitar however nowadays I play acoustic
                guitar in fingerstyle. When I was in my high school at Madetoja I was in a couple of bands. However after school I've
                been playing just by myself. I mainly play cover songs from movies, other artists and games. I arrange the songs myself
                most of the time though sometimes I do work on established arrangements.
                My main guitar is Lakewood M-32 CP that I bought in 2023. My other guitars that I own are Hagstr√∂m Mocon 2 and I have
                Indie electric guitar.

            <div className="textContextText">I started climbing in 2023 and have been doing it very actively ever since. I've mainly done bouldering though I do
                occationally do some rope climbing as well. I've also climbed outdoor. I currently climb on around 7a+ grade though I've
                managed to top a couple of harder routes as well.

                and try many different areas of paragliding.

            <div className="textContextText">Some might not think coffee as a hobby so what I mean with coffee as a hobby is that I have some more coffee
                equipment than just your normal filter coffee maker. I started researching better coffee equipment in 2022 and
                I have been testing all sorts of things regarding coffee since. I have a coffee grinder at home and I own
                couple of different types of coffee makers to give coffee some variety. I also test out different more expensive
                coffees form different roasters.

                done courses for unity but the plan is to start creating my own game down the line.
